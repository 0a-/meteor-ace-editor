#Meteor Ace Editor 

A simple package that asynchronously loads <a href="http://ace.c9.io/">Ace editor</a> to a Meteor app only when it is needed.

> Note: this package is just a "wrapper" around the actual ace editor, asynchronously loading the ace script with XMLHttpRequest when `AceEditor.instance` is called for the first time.

#QuickStart
Add it to your Meteor project
```bash
meteor add arch:ace-editor
```

Let's say you have a `<pre id='archy'></pre>`, and now you want to embed Ace and turn the DOM element into an Ace editor, this is all you need to do:
```javascript
var ace = AceEditor.instance("archy",{
    theme:"dawn", 
    mode:"html"
});
```
> caling `AceEditor.instance("dom")` is basically the same as calling <a href="http://ace.c9.io/#nav=howto"> `ace.edit('dom')` in the Ace API</a>. The only difference is that `AceEditor.instance("dom")` would load the script the first time you call it.
 

#More on working with Ace Editor in Meteor
Using a callback:
```javascript
AceEditor.instance("archy",null,function(editor){
   editor.insert("Live long and prosper.");
   editor.session.getLength();
});
```


Assigning `AceEditor.instance("archy")` to a variable with Tracker.autorun:
```javascript
Tracker.autorun(function (e) {
  editor = AceEditor.instance("archy");
  if(editor.loaded!==undefined){
  e.stop();
  editor.insert("Live long and prosper.");
  }
});
```

`.autorun` is necessary only when the Ace script has not been loaded.
